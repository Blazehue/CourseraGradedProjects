# Student Grade Management System - Project Requirements and Objectives

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a console application to manage student grades. The system will allow adding students, assigning grades for different subjects, calculating average grades, and displaying student records.

## Functional Requirements
1. Add new students with names and IDs
2. Assign grades for different subjects to students
3. Calculate the average grade for each student
4. Display student records with their grades
5. Handle invalid inputs gracefully

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. User-friendly console interface
2. Error handling for invalid inputs
3. Data persistence (in-memory storage for this implementation)
4. Clear output formatting
5. Program should be easy to navigate and use

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a functional console application that manages student grades
2. Implement control structures (if-else, switch) to handle user choices and validation
3. Utilize loops (for, while) for repetitive operations like displaying lists
4. Create and use methods to organize code and perform specific tasks
5. Demonstrate understanding of basic C# programming concepts
6. Ensure code is readable, well-commented, and properly structured
